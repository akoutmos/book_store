Like it’s namesake, the Kubernetes container orchestration system safely manages the many components of a distributed application, organizing the structure and flow of containers and services for maximum efficiency. Kubernetes serves as an operating system for your container clusters, eliminating the need to manually customize the underlying network and server infrastructure into your designs. Kubernetes can be a powerful ally in your battle against application complexity, and this free eBook is the perfect place to get started! is a collection of chapters from  by , member of Red Hat’s Cloud Enablement Team. In it, you’ll learn to take your first steps in the world of Kubernetes and how to use it with Docker to control your clusters. You’ll then discover everything you need to use Pods, Kubernetes-managed clusters of containers, including how to manage and keep them healthy. Finally, you’ll see how to implement services to your Pods and expose them to both internal and external clients. When you finish, you’ll have a good overview of Kubernetes and how to get started with it quickly, opening the door for you to continue your learning and bring it into your daily work!",

One of the central premises of object-oriented programming is that each concern should be implemented as a separate module. However, there are certain system-wide concerns, such as logging, security, performance, and so forth, that often need to be addressed in many, if not all of the modules. Consequently, the code to handle these system-wide concerns may be mixed in with the core logic of a huge number of modules, resulting in lower productivity, poor quality, and systems that are hard to evolve.Aspect-oriented programming overcomes these problems by modularizing the system-wide concerns.AspectJ enables AOP programming in Java by adding a few new language constructs. By using Java as the base language and creating a final system that is compatible with Java byte code specification, AspectJ passes on all the benefits of Java.

One of the central premises of object-oriented programming is that each concern should be implemented as a separate module. However, there are certain system-wide concerns, such as logging, security, performance, and so forth, that often need to be addressed in many, if not all of the modules. Consequently, the code to handle these system-wide concerns may be mixed in with the core logic of a huge number of modules, resulting in lower productivity, poor quality, and systems that are hard to evolve.Aspect-oriented programming overcomes these problems by modularizing the system-wide concerns.AspectJ enables AOP programming in Java by adding a few new language constructs. By using Java as the base language and creating a final system that is compatible with Java byte code specification, AspectJ passes on all the benefits of Java. The use of Java as the base language also makes AspectJ a relatively easy language to learn. is a practical guide to AOP and AspectJ.

Will it regain its power and again drive economic growth as in the past?No.That's the surprising conclusion reached by Erik Keller, a central player in the booming IT world of the 1990s. Driven by fear of being left behind, American corporations let IT grow until it reached one half of all corporate capital spending by the year 2000. Now, chastened by their spending failures, IT managers are converging on a new consensus: to exploit IT competitively they must use their smarts over big money.This shift in thinking comes just as free, open-source software, low-cost international programming labor, and new technologies combine to make the new approach possible.A former Research Fellow at Gartner, Keller had an insider's view of the irrational spending at many Fortune 500 companies, personally influencing billions of dollars of technology acquisitions.In  Keller describes how the new thinking is working inside some of the country's most complex and successful organizations, including Merrill Lynch, JetBlue, Harrah's, and Motorola which have cut IT spending to gain a competitive edge, and experienced marked gains to their bottom lines.As it advances, the new IT think will cause further massive disruptions in the computer business, with fundamental changes in the ways software is developed, sold, and used. Efficiency of IT investment will grow as excess fat is squeezed out of IT salaries, software system costs, and consultants' fees.In an unexpected twist, Keller argues that even as IT spending is reduced its importance for competitiveness will grow. Reduced spending does not mean IT has become a commodity. Counterintuitively, companies that spend less in order to get more from information technology will likely be the big winners.",

One of the central premises of object-oriented programming is that each concern should be implemented as a separate module. However, there are certain system-wide concerns, such as logging, security, performance, and so forth, that often need to be addressed in many, if not all of the modules. Consequently, the code to handle these system-wide concerns may be mixed in with the core logic of a huge number of modules, resulting in lower productivity, poor quality, and systems that are hard to evolve.Aspect-oriented programming overcomes these problems by modularizing the system-wide concerns.AspectJ enables AOP programming in Java by adding a few new language constructs. By using Java as the base language and creating a final system that is compatible with Java byte code specification, AspectJ passes on all the benefits of Java. The use of Java as the base language also makes AspectJ a relatively easy language to learn. is a practical guide to AOP and AspectJ.
